# RAG-Augmented Touristic Recommendations from Airbnb Reviews [![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Source-Yes-green.svg)](https://github.com/YassineEng/RAG-Using-Airbnb-reviews-to-augment-touristic-recommendation-huggingface)

![Project Demo](https://placehold.co/600x400/000000/FFFFFF/gif?text=Project+Demo)


This project leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide touristic recommendations based on a large dataset of Airbnb reviews. By analyzing real guest experiences, the system can answer user queries about cities, neighborhoods, and specific listings, offering nuanced insights that go beyond simple ratings.

## Features

- **RAG-based QA:** Utilizes a RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant Airbnb reviews and generate human-like answers to user questions.
- **FAISS Indexing:** Employs FAISS for efficient similarity search over a large number of review embeddings.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Uses state-of-the-art models from the Hugging Face ecosystem for embeddings and text generation.
- **Interactive CLI:** Provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the RAG model.
- **SQLite Caching:** Caches review embeddings in an SQLite database to speed up subsequent runs.

## Key Technologies

- **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **FAISS:** For efficient similarity search.
- **SQLite:** For caching embeddings.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.

## Models

This project uses the following models from Hugging Face:

- **Embedding Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Language Model:** `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`

## Data

The project uses a dataset of Airbnb reviews. The data is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure quality. The embeddings are generated from the reviews and stored in a FAISS index.

## Data Acquisition

The dataset is not included in this repository. You will need to provide your own `reviews.csv` file.

The data processing and ETL steps are handled in this repository:

[**SQL-ETL-data-warehouse-Inside-Airbnb**](https://github.com/YassineEng/SQL-ETL-data-warehouse-Inside-Airbnb)

1. Follow the instructions in the repository above to process the data and generate the `reviews.csv` file.
2. Create a `data` folder in the root of this project.
3. Place the `reviews.csv` file in the `data` folder.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip for package management

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YassineEng/RAG-Using-Airbnb-reviews-to-augment-touristic-recommendation-huggingface.git
   cd RAG-Using-Airbnb-reviews-to-augment-touristic-recommendation-huggingface
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setup

To use the models from the Hugging Face Hub, you need to set up an environment variable with your access token.

1. **Get your Hugging Face Hub access token:**
   - If you don't have one, create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and go to your [settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) to create a new access token.

2. **Set the environment variable:**
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     set HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
     ```
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
     ```

   Replace `your_token_here` with your actual Hugging Face Hub access token.

## Usage

To start the application, run the `rag_airbnb_main.py` script:

```bash
python rag_airbnb_main.py
```

The application will present you with a menu to either build the embeddings and index from scratch, resume from a previous build, or load the LLM for querying.

Once the model is loaded, you can ask questions like:

- "What are the pros and cons of staying in the Montmartre district of Paris?"
- "Are there any reviews that mention a good view of the Eiffel Tower?"
- "is paris a good city to visit"
- "What are the best restaurants near the Louvre?"
- "What are the best places to visit in New York?"

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias:** The model's recommendations are based on the data it was trained on. This data may contain biases, which could be reflected in the model's recommendations.
- **Privacy:** The data used in this project is publicly available. However, it is important to be mindful of privacy concerns when working with user-generated data.
- **Transparency:** The project is open-source, and the code is available for anyone to inspect.

## Acknowledgments

- The data used in this project was scraped from the [**Inside Airbnb**](http://insideairbnb.com/) website.
- The pre-trained language models are provided by [**Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/).

## Future Work

- **Web interface:** Create a web interface for the application.
- **More data:** Add more data to the model to improve its recommendations.
- **More models:** Experiment with different models to improve the model's performance.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model to a cloud platform.
